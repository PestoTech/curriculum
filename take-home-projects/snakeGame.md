## Pesto Project

The Pesto curriculum is divided into 3 phases. The first phase is a fast-paced refresher of almost all topics related to web development, both front-end, and back-end. We cover the basics, and very quickly dive into in-depth and complicated concepts of each topic. Often times if a student is not mentally prepared to handle the information "shower", he/she can feel left out and a demotivated. 

Hence, we are asking you to oil your mental gears before the program actually starts. This will put you in the right frame of mind. Think of this project as a "warm-up" exercise. It will help ensure you are prepared to handle the fast paced curriculum when the program starts.

This exercise needs to be finished to completion with every feature mentioned in the `Instructions` section before the program begins. In case you are not able to complete it, we will re-review your application and you may be deferred to future batches, or dropped altogether. We do, however, encourage and recommend that you also complete the `Optional Features`.

## Instructions 
- You have to create a **Snake Game** using [`React`](https://reactjs.org/).  
- If you don't know the mechanics of the game, here's a [link](https://playsnake.org/). Remember, your game doesn't have to be a copy of this. Only the mechanics are important.
- The game should be playable using the 4 arrow keys.  
- The game should be able to display a score. 
- You have to make a github repository under your profile and push there all the code. 
- The game should be deployed on a static web hosting site such as `github.io` or `netlify.com`.
- In the beginning, don't focus on the animation/graphics a lot.

## Optional Features 
- Make the user sign-in and allow keeping of personal high-scores.
- Make a leader board displaying highest scores of all times along with username.
- Make multiple levels of the games such that after crossing one level, the speed of the snake increases by some factor. 
- Allow for **rewards** which provide extra bonuses, shortening of snake length, etc. 
- Think of some other additions that you can make to this classic game.
- Write unit tests/integration tests for the game.

## Restrictions 
- Don't copy paste code from anywhere on the web. We have plagiarism detectors and if we find that you have violated this policy, your candidature will be cancelled immediately without any further deliberation.
- **Try not to use any more utility libraries.** Try to code the utilities yourself. You can use [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for a ready-made boilerplate/scaffolding. 

## Deadline
- Before **your** batch starts.
